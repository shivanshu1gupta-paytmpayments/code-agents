# Decision — Architecture Decision Records

## Purpose
Key architectural choices should be documented so future contributors understand *why* things are built the way they are, not just *how*.

## Rules
- [ ] Backend abstraction choice is documented (why cursor + claude, not just one)
- [ ] YAML config approach is explained (why YAML, not code-based agents)
- [ ] OpenAI compatibility choice is documented (why mimic OpenAI API)
- [ ] Session management approach is explained
- [ ] Permission model design rationale exists
- [ ] Streaming implementation choice is documented (SSE, reasoning_content)

## Verification
```bash
# Check for ADR directory or inline decisions
test -d docs/adr && echo "ADR directory exists"
grep -l 'design\|architecture\|decision' README.md Agents.md
```
