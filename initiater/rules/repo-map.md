# Repo Map — Project Structure & Organization

## Purpose
The project structure documented in README.md should match reality. Orphaned files or undocumented directories confuse contributors.

## Rules
- [ ] README.md "Project Structure" tree matches actual file layout
- [ ] No orphaned files in root that should be in subdirectories
- [ ] All Python packages have __init__.py
- [ ] scripts/ directory contents are documented or self-explanatory
- [ ] examples/ directory has its own README or inline docs
- [ ] No generated files committed (build artifacts, __pycache__, .pyc)

## Verification
```bash
# Compare README tree with actual structure
# (visual inspection — automated diff is in run_audit.py)

# Check for __pycache__ or .pyc in git
git ls-files '*.pyc' '__pycache__'

# List root files
ls -1 *.* 2>/dev/null
```
